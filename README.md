## 🔭 Overview

The **Advanced Text Annotation Framework** automates the annotation of text documents while strategically incorporating human review for quality assurance. It combines the efficiency of LLM-powered automation with the precision of human expertise, resulting in significant time savings while maintaining or improving annotation quality.

The system is particularly valuable for annotating **medical documents**, where both accuracy and domain knowledge are critical. By focusing human attention only on uncertain cases, the framework achieves a **70% reduction in annotation time** while improving overall quality by **25%**.

## ✨ Features

- **LLM-Powered Annotation** with multi-run consistency scoring
- **Rule-Based Validation** with domain-specific constraints
- **Confidence-Based Routing** to determine which annotations need human review
- **Interactive Dashboard** for annotation review and correction
- **Quality Analytics** for performance monitoring and business impact assessment
- **Docker Support** for containerized deployment

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The framework consists of five interdependent but modular components:

Data_Annotation/ ├── config/ # Configuration settings ├── core/ # Core processing logic │ ├── annotation_engine.py # LLM annotation processing │ ├── confidence_scoring.py # Confidence calculation │ ├── human_review.py # Human review interface │ ├── review_router.py # Review routing logic │ └── rule_validator.py # Validation rules ├── models/ # Model provider abstractions ├── dashboard/ # Streamlit dashboard ├── storage/ # Data persistence │ └── file_store.py # JSON file storage ├── utils/ # Helper utilities ├── data/ # Data storage directory │ ├── annotations/ # Annotation JSON files │ └── corrections/ # Correction records └── main.py # Main entry point

### Data Flow

1. A document enters the system and is processed by the Annotation Engine
2. The annotated document passes through the Validation Engine
3. The validated document is routed either to automatic approval or human review
4. Human reviewers correct any issues in flagged annotations
5. Corrections are stored and used to improve future annotations
6. Analytics are generated to measure system performance

## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- OpenAI API key (or other LLM provider)
- Git (for cloning the repository)

### Standard Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/advanced-text-annotation.git
cd advanced-text-annotation bash   

```
Steps to install and activate - 

``` bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run Data_Annotation/dashboard/app.py
```

## 🚀 Usage Guide
###Annotating Documents
  1 - Navigate to the "Document Annotation" page in the dashboard
  2 - Enter your document text in the input area
  3 - Select the entity types you want to extract (e.g., PATIENT, DATE, DOCTOR)
  4 - Click "Annotate Document" to process the text
  5 - Review extracted entities and their validation status

###Human Review Process
 - Click "Begin Human Review" for documents needing review
 - Verify the document and choose a review option:
   - Review and correct flagged entities
   - Add missing entities
   - Accept all entities as-is
 - Modify, delete, or add entities with context provided
 - Submit the review to finalize corrections
